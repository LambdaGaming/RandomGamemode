# RandomGamemode
 EXILED plugin for SCP:SL that has a configurable chance (10% by default) of activating a special gamemode when the round starts. Below is the current list of gamemodes.
 
## Dodgeball
- Players spawn as either Class D, Scientist, or Guard on the surface at the MTF spawn
- Everyone gets unlimited SCP-018s with shortened fuse times
- Win conditions are unchanged

## Peanut Raid
- All SCPs are switched to Class D's, everyone else is switched to SCP-173
- Class D is shrunk by 50% and needs to escape and become Chaos Insurgency to win

## Blue Screen of Death
- All SCPs are switched to SCP-079, everyone else is switched to Scientist
- SCP-079 starts off at level 3, scientists start with nothing
- Scientists need to work together to obtain keycards and access heavy containment to kill SCP-079, before 079 can kill them
- Generators take 5 minutes to activate instead of the default 3 minutes
- Each room that SCP-079 visits with the camera will have its lights turned blue

## Night of the Living Nerd
- All SCPs are switched to Scientist, everyone else is switched to Class D
- Class Ds spawn with a flashlight and SCP-268
- Scientist spawns with an LMG, flashlight, 1000 rounds of ammo, increased movement speed, and a facility manager keycard
- Facility lights are turned off for the entirety of the round, players will need to navigate with their flashlights
- Class Ds need to work together to kill the scientist by any means necessary to win the round

## Randomizer
- All roles, spawns, and inventories are randomized
- Friendly fire is enabled and normal win conditions are disabled to prevent the round from ending too early
- Only one SCP will spawn each round since they cannot attack each other
- The round will end when a single player is left alive

## Annoying Mimicry
- All SCPs are switched to 939, everyone else becomes Class D
- When a Class D is killed by 939, they will also become 939
- MTF and Chaos spawning is disabled, and players cannot escape to surface
- Jailbirds spawn in the 049/173 spawn area, so the Class D's have a chance to fight back if they can make it there
- The round will end when all players are SCPs or the Class Ds manage to kill all SCPs

## Locked In
- Light containment never goes into its decontamination phase, and Gate A and B are permanently locked
- With light containment always available and nobody able to escape or activate the nuke, the round will play out very differently
- MTF and Chaos spawn at different locations; MTF spawns in entrance zone and Chaos spawns in a random heavy containment SCP chamber
- Win conditions are unchanged

## Infection
- All SCPs are switched to 049
- SCP-049-2's are larger and have more health
- Players who die are automatically revived as SCP-049-2
- Win conditions are unchanged

# Notes:
- See your EXILED config for options to change specific gamemode settings. (Make sure you run the server at least once with the plugin so the configs generate.)
